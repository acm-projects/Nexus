My name is Indrajith Thyagaraja, a freshman at UTD, one of my friends mentioned that the campus was developing an autonomous vehicle, and I was instantly hooked when I heard that your program was tackling such a difficult engineering challenge. 

I have some robotics experience in high school regarding automation, specifically in terms of localization where I attempted to fuse our odometry, IMU, and camera data to provide effective navigation. Through my struggles, I know just how difficult and necessary it is to have an accurate localization system, so I'm star-struck by the accuracy of your Lidar and Map data systems. I want to understand the deeper components of your localization system and path generation and, if possible, contribute something to your project.

I also saw the open-door policy for joining your project and have started the Onramp task, so I would like to know if you're still accepting new members

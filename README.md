# <h1 align="center">Nexus</h1>

<p align="center">
Students often create group chats for their courses to collaborate and share information, but these groups are not always accessible or inclusive. Nexus solves this problem by providing a centralized platform where every course automatically has a dedicated group. Nexus allows students to communicate, plan ahead, share study notes, and access advanced collaboration tools. These tools include forums, document sharing, and a feature that compares and consolidates typed notes into a comprehensive master document. With Nexus, all students can easily join and benefit from course-specific groups, enhancing their learning experience and academic success.

## Roadblocks and Possible Solutions :construction: :bulb:

- Having everyone‚Äôs machine work with React.
  - If this is an issue then we can switch to Flutter and see if that works, otherwise confer with others to find a better solution that works for everyone.
- Either the Frontend or Backend team falling behind.
  - If this happens the best course would be to get some assistance from the other side until caught up
- Running into AWS Tech Stack Issues.
  - If for any reason we are having a hard time with utilizing AWS in the early stages of development then we immediately switch over to MERN as it is similar.
- Issues with Amazon Kendra or Lex
  - If we are having a hard time developing either of these two, or the cost becomes abnormally high then we switch to alternatives. If not enough available time then switch AI assistance with the next available stretch goal.
